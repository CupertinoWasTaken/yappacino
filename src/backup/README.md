Hello! Seems like you've stumbled upon the `backup folder`.

The backup folder holds files that are meant to be ran instead of the `./yap` executable when it fails.
- `yapped_index.js` - The latest Yappacino source code, transpiled to JavaScript & ready to be ran with `bun src/backup/yapped_index.js`
- `legacy_index.js` - The first Yappacino source code iteration, before it was rewritten in itself. This file is NOT meant to be modified.

Please don't make changes to this folder when submitting a Pull Request! :D
